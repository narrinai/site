## Database Overview

### Total Characters: 100

### Categories Found:
- **Historical**: 8 characters (examples: Copernicus, Frida Kahlo, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi)
- **Anime-manga**: 6 characters (examples: Light Yagami, Hana Kimura, Nanami Yoshikawa, Rimuru Tempest, King)
- **Other categories**: Mostly coaches (business-coach, cooking-coach, accounting-coach, etc.) and fantasy characters

### Key Findings:
1. The characters listed in the index.html file are mostly placeholders that don't exist in the actual Airtable database
2. The database primarily contains coaching and advisor characters rather than the historical and anime characters shown on the homepage
3. Only Light Yagami from the requested list exists in the database with a proper avatar URL
4. The local avatar URLs in index.html (e.g., `/avatars/abraham-lincoln.jpg`) are not connected to actual Airtable data

## Recommendation
The website appears to be using hardcoded placeholder data in the frontend that doesn't match the actual database content. To properly display these characters, they would need to be:
1. Added to the Airtable database with proper avatar URLs
2. Or the frontend should be updated to fetch and display the actual characters that exist in the database
